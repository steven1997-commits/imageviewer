1. [5/5] Code compiles and runs in Android Studio, using the Pixel AVD with API 26.			


## Basic requirements (10%)

2. [4/4] The application consists of a single screen with an image grid and a main toolbar.

6. [5/5] Layouts can be automatically switched based on phone orientation.


7. [5/5] The ratings widget appears in the grid below each image.


8. [5/5] The interface design is usable and aesthetic (e.g., the layout is functional and pleasant, good images were used for the widgets, etc.).


## Images (30%)

9. [10/10] The "load images button" should clear the grid and ratings and load 10 images from the website and display them in the grid.


10. [5/5] The application should support loading and displaying multiple formats, incling JPG and PNG.


11. [5/5] Images are reasonably sized for the device and orientation. Images should be scaled to be visible, but do not need to be scaled to the same size.


12. [5/5] Selecting an image shows an enlarged image. There is a way of dismissing this image.


13. [0/5] The ratings widget appears in the popup below the expanded image.

-5 There is no ratings widget for the expanded image.

## Ranking (20%)

14. [5/5] Individual images can be ranked by changing the rating for the image.


15. [10/10] The ratings filter on the toolbar filters out the images that don't meet this rating or higher.


16. [5/5] Changing the rating of an image should immediately be reflected in the list (i.e. if it no longer meets the filter criteria, it should disappear).
